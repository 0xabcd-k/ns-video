1.Introduction
This agreement is a contract between you and ShortStore, outlining the terms of use and access to the ShortStore services, whether via a paid subscription or a free trial. Thank you for using ShortStore (“ShortStore,” “we,” “us,” “our”). By accessing or using the services, or authorizing others to use them, you agree to this agreement. If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity (“Entity”), you represent that you have the authority to bind such Entity and its affiliates to this agreement. In such case, “Subscriber,” “you,” “your,” or related terms shall refer to such Entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this agreement, you must not accept this agreement or use any services.

2.About Subscriptions
2.1 To ensure that subscribers continuously enjoy the services and auto-renewal, you irrevocably authorize us to automatically charge you for the next subscription period before the end of the current billing period, on a recurring basis. Providing payment details signifies your consent to use this information for fee collection. Subscriptions may be billed weekly, monthly, annually, or for other periods as you choose from the billing periods offered by ShortStore.
2.2 Fees will be automatically deducted from your payment account at the start of each billing period. If auto-renewal fails due to insufficient account balance, the subscriber is solely responsible.
2.3 The content provided under ShortStore’s subscription is limited to use within the ShortStore application and its affiliated platforms. Any malicious or illegal activity to separate the subscription content from ShortStore is not included in the services. ShortStore reserves the right to verify whether your use of the services complies with this agreement. If found non-compliant, ShortStore has the right to charge you, and you are responsible for any damage or loss incurred.

3.Rights and Obligations of Both Parties
3.1 ShortStore provides methods to check auto-renewal subscription orders but is not responsible for delivering invoices to you.
3.2 After successfully charging your payment account, ShortStore will record the payment and renew the subscription under your account.
3.3 If an error occurs during the charging process, ShortStore and you should fully cooperate to identify the cause and bear the losses caused by their own faults. If the losses are due to mutual fault, both parties shall bear the responsibility based on the degree of fault. If the fault cannot be distinguished, the responsibility shall be shared equally.
3.4 ShortStore may change or modify the service content, rules, and terms based on business development or technical upgrades and notify users through the application or relevant pages of the website. If you disagree with the changes, you may cancel the service and stop using ShortStore. Continued use of the services will be deemed as acceptance of the changes.
3.5 You may choose whether to cancel the service. If not canceled, it will be considered that you agree to ShortStore attempting to charge you for the next billing period according to the rules. Once the fee is successfully charged, ShortStore will renew your subscription for the next billing period.
3.6 If the service price changes before or during auto-renewal, the current effective price will prevail.
3.7 ShortStore has the right to adjust service prices based on demand or market changes and will notify you of any price changes through relevant pages.

4.Term and Termination
4.1 This agreement takes effect when you choose to accept the agreement or use the services and terminates when you terminate the services or cancel the subscription.
4.2 You have the right to terminate the services at any time in the account settings. After termination, ShortStore will stop providing services.
4.3 If payment or paid subscription is canceled, and/or any services are terminated before the end of the current subscription period, the subscription fee already paid will not be refunded.

5.Liability for Breach of Contract
In the event of a breach by one party, the other party has the right to seek compensation through the agreed dispute resolution methods.

6.Dispute Resolution and Governing Law
You and ShortStore agree to make a good faith effort to resolve any dispute related to or arising from this agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, either party has the right to submit the dispute to the courts of Singapore for resolution. The interpretation, validity, and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by Singapore law.
